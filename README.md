# Access 2020 Presentation Survey Data



For Access 2020 I [presented](https://elibtronic.github.io/post/access_2020/) on how to market infrastructure to Faculty members. During that presentation I asked particpants to fill in a [survey](https://elibtronic.github.io/post/access_2020_follow_up/). This [notebook](https://github.com/elibtronic/access_2020_presentation_survey/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) is an analysis of some of the results.
